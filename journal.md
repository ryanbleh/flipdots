I did research on how flip dot displays function, and created some first simple 3D printed prototypes.

I'm most concerned on the electrical aspects of this project as I have a reasonable amount of hardware experience

I made a lot more iterations of the single segment, making it tilealbe, more durable, and much easier to print.

As mentioned in yestedays journal, I was concerned about the electrical side of the project. I did a very large amount of research, watching youtube videos, trying to figure out how flip dots work. I believe that this project is outside of skill set, but I am going to try to work through it and take it one step at a time. 

Here are some of the resources I found:

Unfortunatly, with many of these build projects, the creator ceases uploads before finishing the entire project, which makes it more difficult to understand a full picture. 

Here is a electrical schematic for the connector PCB that I am taking inspiration from. (source: The 9000)
